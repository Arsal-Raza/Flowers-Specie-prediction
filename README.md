# Flowers-Specie-prediction
This is web based prediction project using ML and Streamlit .

 I Used the famous Iris dataset to train a decision tree model, saved it as a .pkl file, and created an interactive web app for predicting Iris species. 

Note: You have to run Model.py file first it will train the model on decion tree algorithm and saved it as .pkl file. Then you can run app.py file to see the web based GUI that is made by using streamlit .
